// Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

// A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not.

// Example:
// Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
// Output: true

// Explanation:
// "abc" is a subsequence of "ahbgdc" because you can generate "abc" by deleting the characters "h", "b", and "g" from "ahbgdc" without changing their relative order.
